W01 Learning Activity – Dynamic Arrays

PART 1: Dynamic Arrays

Initial dynamic array:
Capacity = 4
Size = 0
[ _, _, _, _ ]

Insert A:
[ A, _, _, _ ]

Insert B:
[ A, B, _, _ ]

Insert C:
[ A, B, C, _ ]

Insert D:
[ A, B, C, D ]

Insert E:
The array is full, so a new array of capacity 8 is created.
All existing values are copied to the new array.
E is inserted at index 4.

Result:
[ A, B, C, D, E, _, _, _ ]

Remove B:
Removing B requires shifting items to the left.

Result:
[ A, C, D, E ]

Add B to the end:
[ A, C, D, E, B ]

Observation:
Removing an element early in the list requires more work than adding to the end.


PART 2: Evaluating Performance (Big-O)

DoSomething(int n):
Two loops run n times.
O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

DoSomethingElse(List<string> words):
Two nested loops both depend on words.Count.
O(n * n) = O(n^2)

DoAnotherThing(List<string> words):
Outer loop depends on words.Count.
Inner loop depends on sentence length (constant).
O(n * 1) = O(n)
