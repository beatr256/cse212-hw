W02 Learning Activity – Stacks

I manually traced the stack operations in SimpleStack.cs.

Stack is shown from bottom to top.

Final stack contents:
1, 13, 17

Explanation:
The stack follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).
Each Push adds to the back of the stack.
Each Pop removes the most recent item pushed.
After tracing all operations, the remaining values are 1, 13, and 17.
